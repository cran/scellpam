Package: scelllpam
----------------

Version 1.4.2 [2023-02-01]
* Function GetSubdiag rewritten to deal with cases of overflow (too big data).

Version 1.4.3 [2023-03-01]
* Error in JMatInfo messages (it did not affect functionality)
* Error in reading of csv files with tabs (tsv) corrected
* Minimal modifications in vignette scellpam
* Correction in the help of some functions.

Version 1.4.4 [2023-06-20]
* Corrected errors in GetJRow and GetJCol for symmetric matrices when indices are bigger than 65536
* Added the cosine and weighted-Euclidean distances

Version 1.4.5 [2023-09-08]
* Added possibility of reading symmetric matrices from .csv or .tsv files
* Added preferred citation as file inst/CITATION and inside vignette
* Read/write to/from .csv or .tsv checked to avoid strange behaviours when .csv has no row and/or column names.

Version 1.4.6.1 [2024-07-01]
* Added the inclusion of pthread.h in several .cpp files to prevent a compilation failure using LLVM that does not happen with gcc.
  Thanks to Tomas Kalibera for his kind notice.
* Suppressed a line in silhouette.cpp that used a function from the class Rcpp::Language wich internally calls
  funcion SET_TYPEOF which, according to the R sources (see src/include/Rinternals.h) shouldn't be in the API
  and since June, 2023 seems to have been taken by the CRAN maintainers as a failure.
* Added a bibliographic reference missing in vignette parallelpamsc
* Eliminated all uses of Rcpp::warn("%s",any_C_string) since it seems to provoke a strange error of
  Too many conversion specifiers in format string. Indeed, every use of format strings has been eliminated.
  
Version 1.4.6.2 [2024-07-18]
* Change in a header to avoid new warning in C++20 due to the use of template in a constructor.
